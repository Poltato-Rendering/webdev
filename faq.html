<h2>PRODUCT INFO</h2>
<h3>Where do you make your apparel? </h3>
<p>Our products are printed in and shipped from partnered facilities in the US. We only use certified eco-friendly fabrics, ethically sourced from Central America.</p> <br />

<h3>How should I select my shirt size? </h3>
<p>To select the best size, we recommend taking a shirt that fits the way you want, laying it down flat and measuring the distance from one side (just under the sleeve) to the other to obtain your chest width in inches.</p><br />

<h3>How should I wash and care for my shirt? </h3>
<p>To preserve both fabric and print quality, we recommend following these instructions:</p>

<div class="fakeUL">
  <p>◆ Machine wash cold, inside-out on a gentle cycle with mild detergent and like colors. Use non-chlorine bleach when necessary. No fabric softeners.</p>
  <p>◆ Tumble dry on low heat or hang-dry.</p>
  <p>◆ Cool iron inside-out. Do not iron printed graphics directly. </p>
  <p>◆ Do not dry clean. </p>
</div>

<h3>Are your products official anime merch? </h3>
